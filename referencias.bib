abstract = {The bidomain equations are widely used for the simulation of electrical activity in cardiac tissue. They are especially important for accurately modeling extracellular stimulation, as evidenced by their prediction of virtual electrode polarization before experimental verification. However, solution of the equations is computationally expensive due to the fine spatial and temporal discretization needed. This limits the size and duration of the problem which can be modeled. Regardless of the specific form into which they are cast, the computational bottleneck becomes the repeated solution of a large, linear system. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of the equations and the methods by which they have been solved. Of particular note are recent developments in multigrid methods, which have proven to be the most efficient.}

abstract = {The "Virtual Cell" provides a general system for testing cell biological mechanisms and creates a framework for encapsulating the burgeoning knowledge base comprising the distribution and dynamics of intracellular biochemical processes. It approaches the problem by associating biochemical and electrophysiological data describing individual reactions with experimental microscopic image data describing their subcellular localizations. Individual processes are collected within a physical and computational infrastructure that accommodates any molecular mechanism expressible as rate equations or membrane fluxes. An illustration of the method is provided by a dynamic simulation of IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum in a neuronal cell. The results can be directly compared to experimental observations and provide insight into the role of experimentally inaccessible components of the overall mechanism.}

abstract = {The shape of a cell, the sizes of subcellular compartments, and the spatial distribution of molecules within the cytoplasm can all control how molecules interact to produce a cellular behavior. This chapter describes how these spatial features can be included in mechanistic mathematical models of cell signaling. The Virtual Cell computational modeling and simulation software is used to illustrate the considerations required to build a spatial model. An explanation of how to appropriately choose between physical formulations that implicitly or explicitly account for cell geometry and between deterministic versus stochastic formulations for molecular dynamics is provided, along with a discussion of their respective strengths and weaknesses. As a first step toward constructing a spatial model, the geometry needs to be specified and associated with the molecules, reactions, and membrane flux processes of the network. Initial conditions, diffusion coefficients, velocities, and boundary conditions complete the specifications required to define the mathematics of the model. The numerical methods used to solve reaction–diffusion problems both deterministically and stochastically are then described and some guidance is provided in how to set up and run simulations. A study of cAMP signaling in neurons ends the chapter, providing an example of the insights that can be gained in interpreting experimental results through the application of spatial modeling.}

The framework consists of two levels: uncoloured and coloured. Each level comprises a family of related Petri net classes, sharing structure, but being specialized by their kinetic information. Petri nets of all net classes within one level can be converted into each other, while changing the level involves user-guided folding or automatic unfolding. Models can be hierarchically structured, allowing for the mastering of larger networks. Snoopy supports the simultaneous use of several Petri net classes; the graphical user interface adapts dynamically to the active one. Built-in animation and simulation (depending on the net class) are complemented by export to various analysis tools. Snoopy facilitates the extension by new Petri net classes thanks to its generic design.},

In particular, we investigate the mechanisms by which bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae persist at low densities for extended periods, and attain high densities much later. We suggest that the persistence of bacteria in face of immune pressure may result from the bacteria having a very slow growth rate, or having a dormant stage. We show that whereas these mechanisms may lead to long-term persistence, this will be obtained at relatively low densities. We then suggest that the long-term persistence of bacteria may result in the loss of immunity because of the deletion of specific T-cells arriving from the thymus, and the exhaustion of the specific T-cells as these cells reach the Hayflick limit and die. This loss of immunity will allow the bacteria to attain a high density. We propose experiments capable of testing our models and discuss the implications of the models for the treatment of infected hosts.},

  Abstract                 = {Viral kinetics have been extensively studied in the past through the use of spatially homogeneous ordinary differential equations describing the time evolution of the diseased state. However, spatial characteristics such as localized populations of dead cells might adversely affect the spread of infection, similar to the manner in which a counter-fire can stop a forest fire from spreading. In order to investigate the influence of spatial heterogeneities on viral spread, a simple 2-D cellular automaton (CA) model of a viral infection has been developed. In this initial phase of the investigation, the \{CA\} model is validated against clinical immunological data for uncomplicated influenza A infections. Our results will be shown and discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {If improvements are to be made in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, an increased understanding of disease in the lung is needed. Studies have shown that bacteria in a less metabolically active state, which is associated with the presence of lipid bodies, are less susceptible to antibiotics, and recent results have highlighted the disparity in concentration of different compounds into lesions. Treatment success therefore depends critically on the responses of the individual bacteria that constitute the infection. We propose a hybrid, individual-based approach that analyses spatio-temporal dynamics at the level of cells, linking individual cell behaviour with the macroscopic behaviour of cell organisation and the microenvironment. The individual cells (bacteria, macrophages and T cells) are modelled using a cellular automaton (CA) approach and we have incorporated the evolution of oxygen and chemokine dynamics within this hybrid model in order to study the effects of the microenvironment in TB therapies. We allow bacteria to switch states depending on oxygen concentration, which affects how they respond to treatment. Using this multiscale model, we investigate the role of bacterial cell state and of initial bacterial location on treatment outcome. We demonstrate that when bacteria are located further away from blood vessel sources, and when the immune response is unable to contain the less metabolically active bacteria near the start of the simulations, a less favourable outcome is likely.},

However, these data do not always reveal the mechanisms underpinning the observed phenomena. In this paper, we explain why mathematics is a powerful tool for interpreting such data by presenting case studies that illustrate the types of insight that realistic theoretical models of solid tumour growth may yield. These range from discriminating between competing hypotheses for the formation of collagenous capsules associated with benign tumours to predicting the most likely stimulus for protease production in early breast cancer. We will also illustrate the benefits that may result when experimentalists and theoreticians collaborate by considering a novel anti-cancer therapy.},

Whereas the previous standard of care with pegylated interferon and ribavirin had a modest effectiveness, the recent approval of two highly potent protease inhibitors and the ongoing development of dozens of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) constitute a major milestone for HCV therapy. Mathematical modeling of viral kinetics under treatment has played an instrumental role in improving our understanding of virus pathogenesis and in guiding drug development. Here, we review the current state of HCV kinetic modeling, and challenges to the standard biphasic viral decline model that arise when fitting viral kinetic models to data obtained with DAAs.},

  Abstract                 = {A topological and dynamical characterization of the stability boundaries for a fairly large class of nonlinear autonomous dynamic systems is presented. The stability boundary of a stable equilibrium point is shown to consist of the stable manifolds of all the equilibrium points (and/or closed orbits) on the stability boundary. Several necessary and sufficient conditions are derived to determine whether a given equilibrium point (or closed orbit) is on the stability boundary. A method for finding the stability region on the basis of these results is proposed. The method, when feasible, will find the exact stability region, rather than a subset of it as in the Lyapunov theory approach. Several examples are given to illustrate the theoretical prediction.<<ETX>>},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of inflammation on the number of trophozoites and on the murine amoebic liver abscess area following infection with Entamoeba histolytica and E. dispar was evaluated. Immunohistochemistry and digital morphometry were used to identify and quantify the trophozoites, neutrophils, macrophages, and lesions. Positive correlation was observed between the number of trophozoites and inflammatory cells. A significant decrease in parasitism and inflammation in groups treated with dexamethasone was observed. The scarceness or absence of trophozoites in the treated groups suggest the importance of the inflammatory response in the production of amoebic hepatic abscesses in spite of the inherent virulence of the parasite being decisive in the establishment of the lesion.},

  Abstract                 = {Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains have been used for at least a century and are still essential for recognizing various tissue types and the morphologic changes that form the basis of contemporary cancer diagnosis. The stain has been unchanged for many years because it works well with a variety of fixatives and displays a broad range of cytoplasmic, nuclear, and extracellular matrix features. Hematoxylin has a deep blue-purple color and stains nucleic acids by a complex, incompletely understood reaction. Eosin is pink and stains proteins nonspecifically. In a typical tissue, nuclei are stained blue, whereas the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix have varying degrees of pink staining. Well-fixed cells show considerable intranuclear detail. Nuclei show varying cell-type- and cancer-type-specific patterns of condensation of heterochromatin (hematoxylin staining) that are diagnostically very important. Nucleoli stain with eosin. If abundant polyribosomes are present, the cytoplasm will have a distinct blue cast. The Golgi zone can be tentatively identified by the absence of staining in a region next to the nucleus. Thus, the stain discloses abundant structural information, with specific functional implications. A limitation of hematoxylin staining is that it is incompatible with immunofluorescence. It is useful, however, to stain one serial paraffin section from a tissue in which immunofluorescence will be performed. Hematoxylin, generally without eosin, is useful as a counterstain for many immunohistochemical or hybridization procedures that use colorimetric substrates (such as alkaline phosphatase or peroxidase). This protocol describes H&E staining of tissue and cell sections.},

We have observed a suppurative pattern of inflammation associated with infections by rapid-growing Mycobacterium species in immunocompromised patients. We report 6 cases in skin and soft tissue with an unusual but consistent lack of a predominance of granulomatous inflammation. Of the 6 cases, 4 had predominantly (~75%) suppurative inflammation, 1 case predominantly demonstrated (~75%) a mix of acute and chronic inflammation, and 1 case showed an approximately equal contribution of suppurative and granulomatous inflammation. All 6 cases showed abscess formation and numerous acid-fast bacilli (AFB) on AFB stain and were confirmed by tissue culture. Of these 6 cases, 2 had microabscesses with central pseudocysts harboring microorganisms. Five patients were taking oral prednisone, and 1 had an uncharacterized immunodeficiency. These cases highlight the need for awareness of this unusual manifestation of infection with rapid-growing Mycobacterium species, particularly in immunocompromised patients.},

  Abstract                 = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is one of the most frequent pathogens causing divers localized and metastatic abscess-forming infections. Here we studied the role of the staphylocoagulases Coa and vWbp in the formation of microcolony-associated fibrin structures. By using a three-dimensional collagen gel (3D-CoG) supplemented with human fibrinogen as a growth environment for staphylococci and as a neutrophil migration matrix, we were able to demonstrate that Coa is involved in producing a fibrin-containing pseudocapsule wrapping the staphylococcal microcolony whereas vWbp is required for establishing an extended outer fibrin meshwork. The pseudocapsule and the outer meshwork hinder neutrophils from attacking the staphylococci. Addition of the thrombin inhibitor argatroban prevents conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and thus abolishes barrier formation. This <italic>in vitro</italic> model provides us with new options to study formation as well as prevention of staphylococcal abscesses under tissue-like conditions.</p>},

The model features an infection-free state which is locally but not globally attracting implying that a super-threshold bacterial inoculum is required for successful colonization and tissue infection. A subset $B$ of the domain of attraction of the disease-free state is explicitly identified. The dynamics of antibiotic treatment of the infection is also considered. Successful treatment results if the antibiotic dosing regime drives the state of the system into $B$.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of alterations in extracellular pH on cellular and humoral immune function is reviewed. Because acidic pH predominates at inflammatory loci and other sites of immune activity, most studies to date focus on the effect of acidic rather than alkaline pH. Investigations on polymorphonuclear leukocytes demonstrate mainly inhibition of chemotaxis, respiratory activity, and bactericidal capacity at reduced pH. Evidence of impaired lymphocyte cytotoxicity and proliferation at acidic pH is also beginning to emerge. Many of the clinical acidoses are accompanied similarly by immunodeficiency. Studies on macrophages and eosinophils are few and inconclusive. A small number of studies demonstrate acid-induced activation of complement proteins and the alternative complement pathway, plus increased antibody-binding to leukocytes at lowered pH. A differential effect of acidic pH on humoral and cellular immunity may, therefore, exist. Increasing recognition of the significance of extracellular pH in relation to immune function warrants further studies in this presently incomplete but rewarding field.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite major scientific, medical and technological advances over the last few decades, a cure for cancer remains elusive. The disease initiation is complex, and including initiation and avascular growth, onset of hypoxia and acidosis due to accumulation of cells beyond normal physiological conditions, inducement of angiogenesis from the surrounding vasculature, tumour vascularization and further growth, and invasion of surrounding tissue and metastasis. Although the focus historically has been to study these events through experimental and clinical observations, mathematical modelling and simulation that enable analysis at multiple time and spatial scales have also complemented these efforts. Here, we provide an overview of this multiscale modelling focusing on the growth phase of tumours and bypassing the initial stage of tumourigenesis. While we briefly review discrete modelling, our focus is on the continuum approach. We limit the scope further by considering models of tumour progression that do not distinguish tumour cells by their age. We also do not consider immune system interactions nor do we describe models of therapy. We do discuss hybrid-modelling frameworks, where the tumour tissue is modelled using both discrete (cell-scale) and continuum (tumour-scale) elements, thus connecting the micrometre to the centimetre tumour scale. We review recent examples that incorporate experimental data into model parameters. We show that recent mathematical modelling predicts that transport limitations of cell nutrients, oxygen and growth factors may result in cell death that leads to morphological instability, providing a mechanism for invasion via tumour fingering and fragmentation. These conditions induce selection pressure for cell survivability, and may lead to additional genetic mutations. Mathematical modelling further shows that parameters that control the tumour mass shape also control its ability to invade. Thus, tumour morphology may serve as a predictor of invasiveness and treatment prognosis.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present and investigate a model for solid tumor growth that incorporates features of the tumor microenvironment. Using analysis and nonlinear numerical simulations, we explore the effects of the interaction between the genetic characteristics of the tumor and the tumor microenvironment on the resulting tumor progression and morphology. We find that the range of morphological responses can be placed in three categories that depend primarily upon the tumor microenvironment: tissue invasion via fragmentation due to a hypoxic microenvironment; fingering, invasive growth into nutrient rich, biomechanically unresponsive tissue; and compact growth into nutrient rich, biomechanically responsive tissue. We found that the qualitative behavior of the tumor morphologies was similar across a broad range of parameters that govern the tumor genetic characteristics. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the impact of microenvironment on tumor growth and morphology and have important implications for cancer therapy. In particular, if a treatment impairs nutrient transport in the external tissue (e.g., by anti-angiogenic therapy) increased tumor fragmentation may result, and therapy-induced changes to the biomechanical properties of the tumor or the microenvironment (e.g., anti-invasion therapy) may push the tumor in or out of the invasive fingering regime.},

  Abstract                 = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that is caused by infection after inhaling the bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. As a result, two TB-related conditions have been categorized: latent TB infection (not sick but still harboring the bacteria) and active TB disease. If not treated properly, active TB disease can be fatal. Almost 1.3 million die of TB worldwide each year, with ~8,6 million new infections in 2013. No effective vaccine is available to protect against TB and treatment of infection with multiple antibiotics is lengthy (6?9 months), with non-compliance being a major factor for the emergence of drug-resistant strains. A key step in developing effective vaccines and possibly shorter treatment regimens is the ability to identify biomarkers that correlate prognosis and progression to infection (similar to how cholesterol levels are a measure of heart health). In this study we show how pairing computer modeling, statistics and mathematics with datasets derived from non-human primate studies can accelerate biomarker discovery, and offer a new approach to identifying correlates of protection that will be useful in clinical practice, particularly in developing countries where TB is most prevalent.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Clinical isolates of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> secrete coagulases, polypeptides that bind to and activate prothrombin, thereby converting fibrinogen to fibrin and promoting the clotting of plasma or blood. Two staphylococcal products, the canonical coagulase (Coa) as well as the recently identified von Willebrand factor binding protein (vWbp), promote similar modifications of the coagulation cascade during host infection. Staphylococcal binding to fibrinogen or fibrin is an important attribute of disease pathogenesis, which leads to the formation of abscesses and bacterial persistence in host tissues and also enables the pathogen to cause lethal sepsis. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the product of coagulase activity, staphylococci captured within a fibrin meshwork, enable this pathogen to disseminate as thromboembolic lesions and to resist opsonophagocytic clearance by host immune cells. In addition, the coagulation products of staphylococci appear to display discrete differences when compared to those of thrombin-mediated coagulation, the latter representing a key innate defense mechanism against many invading pathogens. Preclinical evidence suggests that inactivation or neutralization of coagulases may prevent the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections, a strategy that could be used to combat the current epidemic of hospital-acquired infections with drug-resistant S. aureus isolates.},

  Abstract                 = {Resolution of acute inflammation is thought to require the recognition and phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils (PMN) through receptor-ligand interactions with macrophages (Mphi). This hypothesis was tested in rat wounds by quantifying apoptosis in freshly harvested and aged-in-culture PMN taken from wounds 1-3 days after injury and by using these wound PMN as phagocytic targets for wound, immune-activated peritoneal, and resident peritoneal Mphi. Less than 6% of freshly harvested PMN exhibited characteristics of apoptosis. On aging in culture, day 1 PMN did not undergo apoptosis, whereas 41+/-1 and 29+/-1% of day 2 and 3 PMN, respectively, developed apoptosis, which corresponded to increased ingestion by Mphi. All three Mphi populations engaged different receptor-ligand pairs for the recognition and phagocytosis of PMN. Results indicate the resistance of early wound PMN to age-induced apoptosis, demonstrate wound-Mphi phagocytosis of wound PMN, and identify distinct receptor utilization by wound and other Mphi to ingest wound PMN.},

The model can reproduce the three-phase development, i.e., the acute period, the asymptotic period and the \{AIDS\} period, observed in the HIV-infected patients in a clinic. We show that the 3D \{HIV\} model performs a better robustness on the model parameters than the 2D cellular automata. Furthermore, we reveal that the occurrence of a perpetual source to successively generate infectious waves to spread to the whole system drives the model from the asymptotic state to the \{AIDS\} state.},

Several attempts have been made to model and predict malignant tumor behavior and also to account for immune system response and the impact of possible clinical treatments. Modeling started from a macroscopic perspective and developed towards cell-based approaches, from which cellular automaton (CA) models are an example.In this article, we first introduce the general concept of CA systems. Then, we review CA models of tumor development, focusing on avascular and vascular growth, tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Finally, a comparative analysis of the models as well as criteria for designing new CA models are provided and future perspectives are outlined.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The Human Immune System (HIS) is responsible for protecting the body against diseases, but the mechanisms used in this task are not completely understood. Mathematical and computational tools can be used for this purpose, and due to the costs involved in simulating the HIS, \{GPUs\} (Graphics Processing Units) are frequently used as the computational platform. The frequency in which \{GPUs\} are used for tasks like this is so high that some processing units, such as the \{APUs\} (Accelerated Processing Units), have integrated then into the \{CPU\} chip. This work presents the implementation on an \{APU\} of a mathematical model that describes part of the HIS. A load balancing strategy was implemented to distribute data with the objective of equalizing the load at each computational device, since \{GPU\} and \{CPU\} are heterogeneous. Gains up to 6.0 Ã , 1.28 Ã and 3.7 Ã were obtained by the balanced version of the code, when compared to the same parallel versions that execute exclusively on CPU, GPU, and on both of them, but without using load balancing, respectively. },

  Abstract                 = {Endothelial activation and infiltration of monocyte macrophages are essential prerequisites for fibrous cap formation, which comprises proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells and net matrix deposition. Macrophage foam cells and endothelium act as a source of growth factors and chemoattractants for smooth muscle cells. However, growth factors alone do not stimulate smooth muscle cell proliferation or migration. This requires, in addition, the remodelling of the extracellular matrix, at least partly mediated by metalloproteinases. In particular, loss of basement membrane components and contact with the interstitial matrix appears to be required to release a brake on proliferation and migration exerted by the basement membrane. Unless there is a change in the phenotype of macrophages in advanced lesions, it is not clear why fibrous cap destruction rather than formation should take place in macrophage-rich shoulder regions of plaques. Impaired cap formation caused by smooth muscle senescence, mummification and propensity to apoptosis may be as important as increased cap destruction in promoting plaque rupture.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim: To investigate whether the inflammatory response of cultured endothelial cells, as induced by conditioned plasma, depends on the bacterial species or type of antibiotic used for incubation with whole blood.Materials and methods: Blood from healthy volunteers was stimulated ex vivo with different microorganisms, and with bacteria killed with different antibiotics. The resultant plasmas were incubated on monolayers of cultured human endothelial cells, followed by measurement of their permeability to albumin and expression of E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1.Results: Incubation of Escherichia coli in blood yielded plasmas that induced a marked increase in endothelial permeability and E-selectin expression. The response to Bacteroides fragilis or Enterococcus faecalis was generally weaker. Similar effects were observed after incubation of whole blood with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Much of the permeability and adhesion molecule response to E. coli remained after removal of intact microorganisms from the culture. Whereas antibiotic treatment of E. coli with imipenem or cefuroxime resulted in a divergent production of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in blood, no significant differences between these treatments were observed with respect to the plasma-induced endothelial response.Conclusion: Bacteria differ in their capacity to generate a whole blood-mediated increase of endothelial permeability and adhesion molecule expression; this response depends, at least in part, on the presence of soluble bacterial components, such as LPS. Whereas treatment with various antibiotics may generate varying amounts of TNF-α, these differences are not translated into differences in endothelial permeability or adhesion molecule expression.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: To investigate the role of endotoxin-induced inflammatory mediators in blood on the permeability of endothelial monolayers. Design: Whole blood of healthy volunteers was treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli, B55:05), and the resultant plasma was added to human umbilical venular endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured on semipermeable membrane inserts (Transwells). Setting: University hospital laboratory. Subjects: Whole blood of healthy volunteers. Interventions: Donor plasma was treated with excess antibodies against either tumor necrosis factor-[alpha], interleukin-1[beta], or both, before the incubation on HUVEC. Measurements and Main Results: The permeability of HUVEC monolayers to fluorescent-labeled albumin and dextran was measured over a 6-hr period, after removal of the stimulus. The production of tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] and interleukin-1[beta] in lipopolysaccharide-treated whole blood was determined by radioimmunoassay. Individually, lipopolysaccharide (10 [mu]g/mL), tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] (10 ng/mL), and interleukin-1[beta] (50 ng/mL) all increased endothelial permeability by about 2.5-fold. A much larger increase could be achieved by preincubation of lipopolysaccharide (10 [mu]g/mL) in whole blood: the resultant plasma induced a ten-fold increase of the permeability. The permeability response after preincubation of lipopolysaccharide in whole blood was time- and dose-dependent. Moreover, this treatment increased the sensitivity of endothelial monolayers to lipopolysaccharide by a factor of several thousand-fold: Whereas high doses of lipopolysaccharide were required for direct stimulation of the permeability, picomolar amounts of lipopolysaccharide in whole blood induced a similar increase. Significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] and interleukin-1[beta] were produced in blood at similar doses of lipopolysaccharide. The addition of antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] or interleukin-1[beta] to plasma partially but significantly abrogated the permeability increase. However, a complete inhibition could be achieved by the simultaneous addition of anti-tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] and anti-interleukin-1[beta] to plasma. Conclusions: Although lipopolysaccharide is capable of directly inducing endothelial permeability, blood-borne tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] and interleukin-1[beta] mediate lipopolysaccharide-induced endothelial permeability at low endotoxin concentrations. These findings support the idea that multifactorial inhibition of inflammatory mediators may improve survival in septic patients.

  Abstract                 = {Interleukin 10 (IL-10) inhibits interferon gamma-induced macrophage activation for cytotoxicity against larvae of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni by suppressing production of the toxic effector molecule nitric oxide (NO). In this study, the mechanism of IL-10 action was identified as inhibition of endogenous tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production by interferon gamma-activated macrophages. TNF-alpha appears to serve as a cofactor for interferon gamma-mediated activation, since both schistosomulum killing and NO production were inhibited by anti-TNF-alpha antibody, whereas TNF-alpha alone was unable to stimulate these macrophage functions. IL-10 blocked TNF-alpha production by interferon gamma-treated macrophages at the levels of both protein and mRNA synthesis. Addition of exogenous TNF-alpha reversed IL-10-mediated suppression of macrophage cytotoxic activity as well as NO production. Likewise, addition of a macrophage-triggering agent (bacterial lipopolysaccharide or muramyl dipeptide), which induced the production of TNF-alpha, also reversed the suppressive effect of IL-10 on cytotoxic function. In contrast to IL-10, two other cytokines, IL-4 and transforming growth factor beta, which also inhibit macrophage activation for schistosomulum killing and NO production, did not substantially suppress endogenous TNF-alpha production. These results, therefore, describe a separate pathway by which macrophage microbicidal function is inhibited by the down-regulatory cytokine IL-10.},

  Abstract                 = {A new mathematical model was used to analyze a detailed set of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) viral load data collected from five infected individuals after the administration of a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Productively infected cells were estimated to have, on average, a life-span of 2.2 days (half-life t1/2 = 1.6 days), and plasma virions were estimated to have a mean life-span of 0.3 days (t1/2 = 0.24 days). The estimated average total HIV-1 production was 10.3 × 109 virions per day, which is substantially greater than previous minimum estimates. The results also suggest that the minimum duration of the HIV-1 life cycle in vivo is 1.2 days on average, and that the average HIV-1 generation time—defined as the time from release of a virion until it infects another cell and causes the release of a new generation of viral particles—is 2.6 days. These findings on viral dynamics provide not only a kinetic picture of HIV-1 pathogenesis, but also theoretical principles to guide the development of treatment strategies.},

Apart from their anti-microbial functions, neutrophils inform and shape subsequent immunity. This immune modulatory functionality might however be considered limited due to their generally accepted short lifespan (<1 day). In contrast to the previously reported short lifespans acquired by ex vivo labeling or manipulation, we show that in vivo labeling in humans using 2H2O under homeostatic conditions, revealed an average circulatory neutrophil lifespan of 5.4 days. This lifespan is at least 10 times longer than previously reported and might lead to reappraisal of novel neutrophil functions in health and disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Ever since \{HIV\} was first diagnosed in human, a great number of scientific works have been undertaken to explore the biological mechanisms involved in the infection and progression of the disease. Several cellular automata (CA) models have been introduced to gain insights into the dynamics of the disease progression but none of them has taken into account effects of certain immune cells such as the dendritic cells (DCs) and the \{CD8\} + T lymphocytes (CD8 + T cells). In this work, we present a \{CA\} model, which incorporates effects of the \{HIV\} specific immune response focusing on the cell-mediated immunities, and investigate the interaction between the host immune response and the \{HIV\} infected cells in the lymph nodes. The aim of our work is to propose a model more realistic than the one in Precharattana etÃÂ al. (2010) [10], by incorporating roles of the DCs, the \{CD4\} + T cells, and the \{CD8\} + T cells into the model so that it would reproduce the \{HIV\} infection dynamics during the primary phase of \{HIV\} infection. },

  Abstract                 = {Chlamydia species infect epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces, and are major causes of sexually transmitted diseases. Infection is characterized by inflammation which is exacerbated upon reinfection, ultimately leading to tissue damage and scarring. Although central for the development of disease manifestations, little is known about the mechanisms that initiate and sustain the inflammatory response to Chlamydia. Infection of cervical and colonic epithelial cells with Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia psittaci is shown in the present studies to upregulate mRNA expression and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8, GRO alpha, GM-CSF, and IL-6. In contrast to the rapid, but transient, cytokine induction following infection with other invasive bacteria, the epithelial cytokine response to Chlamydia was delayed until 20-24 h after infection, persisted throughout the chlamydial growth cycle (2-4 d), and required bacterial protein synthesis. Moreover, epithelial cell lines and primary endocervical epithelial cells released IL-1alpha after Chlamydia infection, and increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines could be inhibited by anti-IL-1alpha. This suggests that IL-1alpha, released following lysis of infected epithelial cells, may amplify the inflammatory response by stimulating additional cytokine production by noninfected neighboring cells. These findings suggest a novel pathophysiologic concept wherein the acute host response to Chlamydia at mucosal surfaces is primarily initiated and sustained by epithelial cells, the first and major targets of chlamydial infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Staphylococcus aureus is a frequent cause of skin infection and sepsis in humans. Preclinical vaccine studies with S. aureus have used a mouse model with intraperitoneal challenge and survival determination as a measure for efficacy. To appreciate the selection of protective antigens in this model, we sought to characterize the pathological attributes of S. aureus infection in the peritoneal cavity. Testing C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice, >109 CFU of S. aureus Newman were needed to produce a lethal outcome in 90% of animals infected via intraperitoneal injection. Both necropsy and histopathology revealed the presence of intraperitoneal abscesses in the vicinity of inoculation sites. Abscesses were comprised of fibrin as well as collagen deposits and immune cells with staphylococci replicating at the center of these lesions. Animals that succumbed to challenge harbored staphylococci in abscess lesions and in blood. The establishment of lethal infections, but not the development of intraperitoneal abscesses, was dependent on S. aureus expression of alpha-hemolysin (Hla). Active immunization with nontoxigenic HlaH35L or passive immunization with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies protected mice against early lethal events associated with intraperitoneal S. aureus infection but did not affect the establishment of abscess lesions. These results characterize a mouse model for the study of intraperitoneal abscess formation by S. aureus, a disease that occurs frequently in humans undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal disease.},

  Abstract                 = {The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica is the causative agent of amoebiasis, a human disease characterized by dysentery and liver abscess. The physiopathology of hepatic lesions can be satisfactorily reproduced in the hamster animal model by the administration of trophozoites through the portal vein route. Hamsters were infected with radioactively labeled amoebas for analysis of liver abscess establishment and progression. The radioimaging of material from parasite origin and quantification of the number inflammation foci, with or without amoebas, described here provides the first detailed assessment of trophozoite survival and death during liver infection by E. histolytica. The massive death of trophozoites observed in the first hours postinfection correlates with the presence of a majority of inflammatory foci without parasites. A critical point for success of infection is reached after 12 h when the lowest number of trophozoites is observed. The process then enters a commitment phase during which parasites multiply and the size of the infection foci increases fast. The liver shows extensive areas of dead hepatocytes that are surrounded by a peripheral layer of parasites facing inflammatory cells leading to acute inflammation. Our results show that the host response promotes massive parasite death but also suggest also that this is a major contributor to the establishment of inflammation during development of liver abscess.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Erwin Schrödinger pointed out in his 1944 book “What is Life” that one defining attribute of biological systems seems to be their tendency to generate order from disorder defying the second law of thermodynamics. Almost parallel to his findings, the science of complex systems was founded based on observations on physical and chemical systems showing that inanimate matter can exhibit complex structures although their interacting parts follow simple rules. This is explained by a process known as self-organization and it is now widely accepted that multi-cellular biological organisms are themselves self-organizing complex systems in which the relations among their parts are dynamic, contextual and interdependent. In order to fully understand such systems, we are required to computationally and mathematically model their interactions as promulgated in systems biology. The preponderance of network models in the practice of systems biology inspired by a reductionist, bottom-up view, seems to neglect, however, the importance of bidirectional interactions across spatial scales and domains. This approach introduces a shortcoming that may hinder research on emergent phenomena such as those of tissue morphogenesis and related diseases, such as cancer. Another hindrance of current modeling attempts is that those systems operate in a parameter space that seems far removed from biological reality. This misperception calls for more tightly coupled mathematical and computational models to biological experiments by creating and designing biological model systems that are accessible to a wide range of experimental manipulations. In this way, a comprehensive understanding of fundamental processes in normal development or of aberrations, like cancer, will be generated.},

  Abstract                 = {A cellular automaton model for the effects of population movement and vaccination on epidemic propagation is presented. Each cellular automaton cell represents a part of the total population that may be found in one of three states: infected, immunized and susceptible. As parts of the population move randomly in the cellular automaton lattice, the disease spreads. We study the effect of two population movement parameters on the epidemic propagation: the distance of movement and the percentage of the population that moves. Furthermore, the model is extended to include the effect of the vaccination of some parts of the population on epidemic propagation. The model establishes the acceleration of the epidemic propagation because of the increment, of the percentage of the moving population, or of the maximum distance of population movement. On the contrary, the effect of population vaccination reduces the epidemic propagation. The proposed model can serve as a basis for the development of algorithms to simulate real epidemics based on real data. },

  Abstract                 = {In acute inflammation, infiltrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (also known as PMNs) release preformed granule proteins having multitudinous effects on the surrounding environment. Here we present what we believe to be a novel role for PMN-derived proteins in bacterial phagocytosis by both human and murine macrophages. Exposure of macrophages to PMN secretion markedly enhanced phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized Staphylococcus aureus both in vitro and in murine models in vivo. PMN secretion activated macrophages, resulting in upregulation of the FcÎ³ receptors CD32 and CD64, which then mediated the enhanced phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized bacteria. The phagocytosis-stimulating activity within the PMN secretion was found to be due to proteins released from PMN primary granules; thorough investigation revealed heparin-binding protein (HBP) and human neutrophil peptides 1--3 (HNP1--3) as the mediators of the macrophage response to PMN secretion. The use of blocking antibodies and knockout mice revealed that HBP acts via Î²2 integrins, but the receptor for HNP1--3 remained unclear. Mechanistically, HBP and HNP1--3 triggered macrophage release of TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³, which acted in an autocrine loop to enhance expression of CD32 and CD64 and thereby enhance phagocytosis. Thus, we attribute what may be a novel role for PMN granule proteins in regulating the immune response to bacterial infections. },

The model offers predictions regarding cytokine regulation and the effects of perturbations of the immune system, as well as the time course of infections in hosts that had previously encountered the pathogens. We experimentally validate the prediction that convalescent hosts can rapidly clear both pathogens, while antibody transfer cannot substantially reduce the duration of a <named-content xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> infection.

  Abstract                 = {During the past decade a unifying hypothesis has been developed to explain the vascular changes that occur in septic shock on the basis of the effect of inflammatory mediators on the vascular endothelium. The vascular endothelium plays a central role in the control of microvascular flow, and it has been proposed that widespread vascular endothelial activation, dysfunction and eventually injury occurs in septic shock, ultimately resulting in multiorgan failure. This has been characterized in various models of experimental septic shock. Now, direct and indirect evidence for endothelial cell alteration in humans during septic shock is emerging. The present review details recently published literature on this rapidly evolving topic.},

  Abstract                 = {The Translational Dilemma, the difficulty in achieving effective translation of basic mechanistic biomedical knowledge into effective therapeutics, is the greatest challenge in biomedical research. Nowhere is this more apparent than in understanding and manipulating the acute inflammatory response in the settings of sepsis, trauma/hemorrhage, wound healing, and related processes. The burgeoning fields of complex systems analysis and computational biology offer researchers a pathway towards addressing the Translational Dilemma. Complex Systems and Computational Biology Approaches to Acute Inflammation presents the current state of the art of multi-disciplinary and systems-oriented research approaches to complex diseases arising from and driven by the acute inflammatory response. The chapters in this volume provide an introduction to different types of computational modeling, and how these methods can be applied to specific inflammatory diseases, with a focus on providing readers with a roadmap for integrating advanced mathematical and computational techniques with traditional experimental methods. By presenting the role of computational modeling as an integrated component of the research process, Complex Systems and Computational Biology Approaches to Acute Inflammation offers a window into the future of biomedical research.},

  Abstract                 = {Chemotaxis of rabbit mononuclear cells was studied by the micropore-filter technique. Mononuclear cells obtained from mineral oil-induced peritoneal exudates respond chemotactically to rabbit serum treated with immune complexes or with streptokinase and plasminogen, to soluble factors produced by bacteria, and to lysates obtained from rabbit neutrophils. The first chemotactic factor requires heat-labile factors in serum for its generation, but, once formed, the chemotactic factor is relatively heat stable. This factor has been compared with the complement-associated factor in serum, C'(5, 6, 7)a, that is chemotactic for neutrophils. The ability to generate the mononuclear cell chemotactic factor in serum that has been treated with potassium thiocyanate suggests that complement is not required. The position of the chemotactic factor in preparative electrophoresis and density-gradient ultracentrifugation indicates that on the basis of physical-chemical criteria, this factor is not C'(5, 6, 7)a. The mononuclear cell chemotactic factor present in lysates of neutrophils sediments slowly in the ultracentrifuge and may be related, at least in part, to cationic peptides of lysosomal granules. A study in the time course of the chemotactic response of mononuclear cells reveals that the response begins to level off after 4 or 5 hr. This is in sharp contrast to the time course for the chemotactic response of neutrophils, in which the reaction is complete within 1.5 hr. Rabbit mononuclear cells obtained from a starch-induced peritoneal exudate respond to serum treated with plasminogen and streptokinase and to the soluble factor produced by bacteria, but no chemotactic response is elicited to serum treated with immune complexes. This indicates a functional difference between two populations of mononuclear cells. Rabbit alveolar macrophages respond poorly to all agents tested, although a weak chemotactic response to bacterial factors was found. The requirement of a serine esterase in the mononuclear cell for the cell to respond chemotactically was defined by the use of organophosphorus inhibitors. Pretreatment of mononuclear cells with several series of phosphonates renders them unresponsive in the chemotactic system. The effect is similar for mononuclear cells responding chemotactically to activated serum and to the bacterial chemotactic factor. Several points of contrast with inhibition profiles obtained in the chemotactic system of the neutrophil suggest that, while the mononuclear cell requires a serine esterase for chemotactic responsiveness, this enzyme is different from the one previously defined in the neutrophil.},

  Abstract                 = {A simplified mathematical model of immune responds to Hepatitis B Virus (HIBV) infection is presented. This focuses on the control of the infection by the interferons, the innate and adaptive immunity. The model was compartmentalized as appropriate and the resulting model equations were solved numerically. A mathematical analysis of the model shows that both disease-free and endemic equilibrium point exist and we derive conditions for their stability. We perform sensitivity analysis on the model parameters, to account for the variability and speed of adaptation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  Abstract                 = {The existing models of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection dynamics are based on the assumption that the populations of viruses and cells are uniformly mixed. However, the real virus infection system is actually not homogeneous and some spatial factors might play a nontrivial role in governing the development of \{HBV\} infection and its outcome. For instance, the localized populations of dead cells might adversely affect the spread of infection. To consider this kind of inhomogeneous feature, a simple 2D (dimensional) probability Cellular Automaton model was introduced to study the dynamic process of \{HBV\} infection. The model took into account the existence of different types of \{HBV\} infectious and non-infectious particles. The simulation results thus obtained showed that the Cellular Automaton model could successfully account for some important features of the disease, such as its wide variety in manifestation and its age dependency. Meanwhile, the effects of the model’s parameters on the dynamical process of the infection were also investigated. It is anticipated that the Cellular Automaton model may be extended to serve as a useful vehicle for studying, among many other complicated dynamic biological systems, various persistent infections with replicating parasites. },

While the control of virulence gene expression in vitro by agr has been relatively straightforward to describe, regulation of both the quorum response itself and virulence genes in vivo is considerably more complex. The quorum response is highly dependent upon the environment in which the organism is grown and is strongly influenced by additional regulators that respond to signals other than cell density. There is increasing evidence that the agr phenotype may influence the behavior and pathogenesis of biofilm-associated S. aureus and S. epidermidis and may contribute to the chronic nature of some biofilm-associated infections.},

The model takes into account the global features of the immune response to any pathogen, the fast mutation rate of the HIV, and a fair amount of spatial localization, which may occur in the lymph nodes. Our results reproduce the three-phase pattern observed in T cell and virus counts of infected patients, namely, the primary response, the clinical latency period, and the onset of AIDS. The dynamics of real experimental data is related to the transient behavior of our model and not to its steady state. We have also found that the infected cells organize themselves into spatial structures, which are responsible for the decrease on the concentration of uninfected cells, leading to AIDS.},

  abstract  = {Systemic inflammatory response syndrome and its progression to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome represent a major challenge in the field of trauma and critical care medicine. This disease state is a product of disorders of the bodyâs natural response to injury. Attempts to treat this at a molecular level using information from basic science research have been unsuccessful, even detrimental. It is possible that this is due to a failure to account for the nonlinear, complex nature of the inflammatory response in formulating treatment regimes. It is proposed that agent-based computer simulation may be a way to characterize the dynamics of the inflammatory response. This article presents an abstract model of a generic tissue system. Modeling the inflammatory response as a nonlinear complex system may produce simulations that will shed light on the complex nature of the inflammatory response. In the future, more sophisticated simulations may provide a testing framework for designing and evaluating treatment regimes.},

  abstract  = {We have investigated the use of a novel technique, in situ end-labelling, as a means of the specific identification of apoptotic cells in formalin-fixed, paraffin-processed tissue sections. The technique relies on the presence of DNA strand breaks in apoptotic cells, caused by activation of endogenous nuclease activity during the process of cell death. These strands are labelled with a non-isotopic reporter molecule in the presence of a DNA polymerase, and labelled DNA is identified immunohistochemically. We show that in situ end-labelling stains cells with the morphological characteristics of apoptosis, and greatly simplifies their identification. Furthermore, in two model systems, the number of labelled cells parallels the number of cells undergoing apoptosis as measured by alternative techniques. The ability of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase to label apoptotic nuclei suggests that the characteristic DNA fragmentation seen during this process involves the formation of DNA breaks with a 5â² overhang. in situ end-labelling will be valuable for the identification and quantitation of apoptosis in a range of normal tissues and in a variety of pathological states. However, the technique is not specific for programmed cell death, and results must be interpreted with caution and correlated with morphological criteria of apoptosis.},

  abstract  = {Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, an important human pathogen, display up to 20% variability in their genome sequence, and most sequence information is available for human clinical isolates that have not been subjected to genetic analysis of virulence attributes. S. aureus strain Newman, which was also isolated from a human infection, displays robust virulence properties in animal models of disease and has already been extensively analyzed for its molecular traits of staphylococcal pathogenesis. We report here the complete genome sequence of S. aureus Newman, which carries four integrated prophages, as well as two large pathogenicity islands. In agreement with the view that S. aureus Newman prophages contribute important properties to pathogenesis, fewer virulence factors are found outside of the prophages than for the highly virulent strain MW2. The absence of drug resistance genes reflects the general antibiotic-susceptible phenotype of S. aureus Newman. Phylogenetic analyses reveal clonal relationships between the staphylococcal strains Newman, COL, NCTC8325, and USA300 and a greater evolutionary distance to strains MRSA252, MW2, MSSA476, N315, Mu50, JH1, JH9, and RF122. However, polymorphism analysis of two large pathogenicity islands distributed among these strains shows that the two islands were acquired independently from the evolutionary pathway of the chromosomal backbones of staphylococcal genomes. Prophages and pathogenicity islands play central roles in S. aureus virulence and evolution.},

  abstract  = {The growth and remodeling of soft tissues depend on a number of biological, chemical and mechanical factors, including the state of tension. In many cases the stress field plays such a relevant role that â€œstress-modulated growthâ€� has become a very topical subject. Recent theoretical achievements suggest that, irrespective of the specific biological material at hand, a component of the stressâ€”growth coupling is tissue-independent and reads as an Eshelby-like tensor. In this paper we investigate the mathematical properties and the qualitative behavior predicted by equations that specialize that model under few simple assumptions. Constitutive equations that satisfy a suitable dissipation principle are compared with heuristic ones that fit well the experimental data. Numerical simulations of the growth of a symmetric annulus are discussed and compared with the predicted qualitative behavior.},

  abstract  = {Objectives: To introduce a form of mathematical modeling, agent-based modeling (ABM), and demonstrate its potential uses in the evaluation of the dynamics of the innate immune response (IIR) and the development of possible treatments for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)/multiple organ failure (MOF).
Rationale: The IIR can be categorized as a complex system that responds to interventions in a nonintuitive fashion, leading to difficulty in translating basic science knowledge into effective treatments for SIRS/MOF. It is proposed that ABM is particularly well suited to examining the complex interactions of the IIR and its disordered states of SIRS/MOF.
Study Design: Computer simulation and mathematical modeling.
Data Source: Review articles on components and mechanisms involved in the IIR. Published results from phase III anticytokine/mediator trials. Published results from smaller clinical trials and animal studies.
Main Results: An abstract ABM of the IIR was created. The model reproduces the general behavior of the IIR with respect to outcome and cause of system “death.” Patterns of levels of individual cytokines matched patterns of measured cytokines reported in the existing literature. Clinical trials of anticytokine therapy were simulated and produced outcomes qualitatively similar to those reported in the literature. A series of hypothetical treatment regimes (variation of dose and length of treatment [anti-tumor necrosis factor and anti-interleukin-1], anti-CD-18, and multiple-drug regimes [combination of anti-tumor necrosis factor, anti-interleukin-1, and anti-CD-18]) were formulated and implemented in the ABM. None of the simulated therapies showed a statistically significant improvement in system mortality.
Conclusions: Presented herein is an abstracted ABM of the IIR. This model is intended primarily as an introduction to and demonstration of this technique. However, even this relatively simple model demonstrates counterintuitive system responses and the difficulty of effectively manipulating a complex system like the IIR. ABM may provide a synthetic, analytical platform to integrate basic science data on the IIR, thus eventually aiding in formulating and testing future mediator-directed therapies for SIRS/MOF before clinical trials, and it may provide insights into directions of future research.},

  abstract  = {Staphylococcus aureus infections are associated with abscess formation and bacterial persistence; however, the genes that enable this lifestyle are not known. We show here that following intravenous infection of mice, S. aureus disseminates rapidly into organ tissues and elicits abscess lesions that develop over weeks but cannot be cleared by the host. Staphylococci grow as communities at the center of abscess lesions and are enclosed by pseudocapsules, separating the pathogen from immune cells. By testing insertional variants in genes for cell wall-anchored surface proteins, we are able to infer the stage at which these molecules function. Fibrinogen-binding proteins ClfA and ClfB are required during the early phase of staphylococcal dissemination. The heme scavenging factors IsdA and IsdB, as well as SdrD and protein A, are necessary for abscess formation. Envelope-associated proteins, Emp and Eap, are either required for abscess formation or contribute to persistence. Fluorescence microscopy revealed Eap deposition within the pseudocapsule, whereas Emp was localized within staphylococcal abscess communities. Antibodies directed against envelope-associated proteins generated vaccine protection against staphylococcal abscess formation. Thus, staphylococci employ envelope proteins at discrete stages of a developmental program that enables abscess formation and bacterial persistence in host tissues.—Cheng, A. G., Kim, H. K., Burts, M. L., Krausz, T., Schneewind, O., Missiakas, D. M. Genetic requirements for Staphylococcus aureus abscess formation and persistence in host tissues.},

  abstract  = {The anti-granulocyte receptor-1 (Gr-1) mAb, RB6-8C5, has been used extensively to deplete neutrophils in mice and to investigate the role of these cells in host defense. RB6-8C5 binds to Ly6G, which is present on neutrophils, and to Ly6C, which is expressed on neutrophils, dendritic cells, and subpopulations of lymphocytes and monocytes. It is thus likely that in vivo administration of RB6-8C5 may deplete not only neutrophils but also other Gr-l+ (Ly6C+) cells. This study describes the use of an Ly6G-specific mAb, 1A8, as an alternative means to deplete neutrophils. In vivo administration of RB6-8C5 reduced blood neutrophils and Gr-1+ monocytes, whereas administration of 1A8 reduced blood neutrophils but not Gr-1+ monocytes. Plasma TNF-ÃÂ± in endotoxemia was increased 20-fold by RB6-8C5 pretreatment and fourfold by 1A8 pretreatment. In a wound model, pretreatment with either antibody decreased wound neutrophils and macrophages. TNF-ÃÂ± staining in brefeldin-treated wound leukocytes was increased by pretreatment with RB6-8C5, but not 1A8. Neutrophil depletion with 1A8 offers advantages over the use of RB6-8C5, as it preserves non-neutrophil Gr-1+ cells depleted by the anti-Gr-1 antibody. The loss of non-neutrophil Gr-1+ populations in RB6-8C5-treated animals is associated with increased TNF-ÃÂ± responses, suggesting these cells may function to suppress TNF-ÃÂ± production.},

Data indicating the contribution of a single catalase and superoxide dismutase in intracellular survival of Staphylococcus aureus were provided using established biochemical assays.

  abstract  = {Abstract In this paper we revisit the classic LotkaâVolterra model of competition between two populations and present some new results on the regime of bistability presented by this model. Initially, we review the results on the global stability analysis of the system and present a new global energy function. Then, we extend the model analysis in the case of strong competition, when the system has two asymptotically stable equilibria. The influence of parameters on the size and shape of the basins of attraction of these equilibria was characterized. The results show that the higher the rate of interspecific competition of a population, the greater the basin of attraction of the stable equilibrium that corresponds to the predominance of the same. In addition, the relative birth rate of population influences the curvature of the boundary between the basins of attraction which is the stable manifold of a saddle point. The influence analysis of this parameter reveals an interesting relation. Which population has more chances to survive depends on the context in which the initial conditions take place. In the case where populations begin with a large number of individuals, the one with a smaller birth rate will survive; in the case where populations begin with few individuals, the one with a greater birth rate will survive. We showed this result analytically by using the Picard method to approximate invariant manifolds and to obtain the expression for the curvature of the stability boundary. Finally, the analysis of the joint influence of competition and reproduction on the thresholds for initial conditions was made and the biological implications were discussed. We conclude that in terms of strategy for survival of a population, it is more efficient to adjust its reproductive rate than to improve its ability to withdraw resources from the environment.},

  abstract  = {The gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen responsible for a variety of diseases ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening conditions such as sepsis. Cell wall-associated and secreted proteins (e.g., protein A, hemolysins, and phenol-soluble modulin) and cell wall components (e.g., peptidoglycan and alanylated lipoteichoic acid) have been shown to be inflammatory, and these staphylococcal components may contribute to sepsis. On the host side, many host factors have been implicated in the innate detection of staphylococcal components. One class of pattern recognition molecules, Toll-like receptor 2, has been shown to function as the transmembrane component involved in the detection of staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid and phenol-soluble modulin and is involved in the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes/macrophages in response to these components. Nod2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2) is the intracellular sensor for muramyl dipeptide, the minimal bioactive structure of peptidoglycan, and it may contribute to the innate immune defense against S. aureus. The staphylococcal virulence factor protein A was recently shown to interact directly with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 in airway epithelium and to reproduce the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha. Finally, peptidoglycan recognition protein L is an amidase that inactivates the proinflammatory activities of peptidoglycan. However, peptidoglycan recognition protein L probably plays a minor role in the innate immune response to S. aureus. Thus, several innate immunity receptors may be implicated in host defense against S. aureus.},

  abstract  = {Colonies of bacteria,Bacillus subtilis, that grow on the surface of thin agar plates show various morphological patterns in response to environmental conditions, such as the nutrient concentration, the solidity of an agar medium and temperature. For instance, the colony pattern shows a dense-branching morphology with a smooth circular envelope (DBM-like) in a nutrient-poor semi-solid agar medium, and it turns to a simple disk-like colony as both the nutrient concentration and the agar's softness increase. These patterns have been shown to involve cell movement inside colonies. In a DBM-like colony, individual cells actively move, particularly in the expanding periphery of the colony, while they become immotile at the inner region of the colony where nutrient is very low. In a disk-like colony, cells are highly active in the whole region of the colony. Based on such experimental observations, we develop a diffusion-reaction model, in which density dependent cell movements are incorporated by the level of nutrient concentration available for the cell. Numerical simulations of the model under different environmental conditions closely reproduce various colony patterns ranging from DBM-like pattern to the homogeneous disk-like one in a unifying manner. The analysis also predicts the growth velocity of a colony as a function of the nutrient concentration.},

Even with therapy, abscesses can persist or even reoccur, as staphylococcal infections fail to induce protective immune responses. Here, we show that prior infection with certain attenuated strains may elicit protective immunity. A closer examination reveals that protection correlates with antibody responses elicited on exposure to particular attenuated variants. Linear regression analysis was used to compare reduction in staphylococcal disease and antibody responses to infection with wild-type and attenuated variants. This analysis identified protective antigens that, when tested as vaccines in mice, elicited disease protection. Protection afforded by attenuated strains correlates in part with the ability of Staphylococcus aureus to modulate B cell responses via protein A (spa encoded). We designate this approach âgenetic vaccinology,â since it exploits genetic variants to draw a correlation between disease protection and humoral immune responses for the deduction of vaccine antigens. Genetic vaccinology is particularly useful for microbes that do not elicit natural protective immunity during infection.âKim, H. K., Kim, H. -Y., Schneewind, O., Missiakas, D.

  abstract  = {<p>Bacterial infections occur when the natural host defenses are overwhelmed by invading bacteria. The main component of the host defense is impaired when neutrophil count or function is too low, putting the host at great risk of developing an acute infection. In people with intact immune systems, neutrophil count increases during bacterial infection. However, there are two important clinical cases in which they remain constant: a) in patients with neutropenic-associated conditions, such as those undergoing chemotherapy at the nadir (the minimum clinically observable neutrophil level); b) in ex vivo examination of the patient's neutrophil bactericidal activity. Here we study bacterial population dynamics under fixed neutrophil levels by mathematical modelling. We show that under reasonable biological assumptions, there are only two possible scenarios: 1) Bacterial behavior is monostable: it always converges to a stable equilibrium of bacterial concentration which only depends, in a gradual manner, on the neutrophil level (and not on the initial bacterial level). We call such a behavior type I dynamics. 2) The bacterial dynamics is bistable for some range of neutrophil levels. We call such a behavior type II dynamics. In the bistable case (type II), one equilibrium corresponds to a healthy state whereas the other corresponds to a fulminant bacterial infection. We demonstrate that published data of in vitro <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> bactericidal experiments are inconsistent with both the type I dynamics and the commonly used linear model and are consistent with type II dynamics. We argue that type II dynamics is a plausible mechanism for the development of a fulminant infection.</p>},

  abstract  = {mdash;: The management of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)/Multiple Organ Failure (MOF) remains the greatest challenge in the field of critical care. There has been uniform difficulty in translating the results of basic science research into effective therapeutic regimes. We propose that this is due in part to a failure to account for the complex, nonlinear nature of the inflammatory process of which SIRS/MOF represents a disordered state. Attempts to manipulate this process without an understanding of the dynamics of the system may potentially produce unintended consequences. Agent-Based Computer Simulation (ABCS) provides a means to synthesize the information acquired from the linear analysis of basic science into a model that preserves the complexity of the inflammatory system. We have constructed an abstracted version of the inflammatory process using an ABCS that is based at the cellular level. Despite its abstraction, the simulation produces non-linear behavior and reproduces the dynamic structure of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, adjustment of the simulation to model one of the unsuccessful initial anti-inflammatory trials of the 1990's demonstrates the adverse outcome that was observed in those clinical trials. It must be emphasized that the current model is extremely abstract and simplified. However, it is hoped that future ABCSs of sufficient sophistication eventually may provide an important bridging tool to translate basic science discoveries into clinical applications. Creating these simulations will require a large collaborative effort, and it is hoped that this paper will stimulate interest in this form of analysis.

While the first paper in the series elaborated a general formulation for such a theory, the present paper develops a simple biphasic model of residual stress evolution in a growing multicell spheroid comprising a linear-elastic cellular phase and an inviscid interstitial fluid. Both isotropic and anisotropic growth are considered in this study, highlighting the necessity to incorporate stress relaxation in order to predict an evolution of stresses over a period of growth. The solutions to the biphasic equations are juxtaposed with the corresponding solutions to the single phase equations, illuminating the approximate nature of the single phase formulation for growing tissues. Moreover, the analysis demonstrates the significance of both interphase drag and the stress-relaxation characteristics of the solid phase in distinguishing between the single phase and multiphase paradigms.}},

A parabolic quasi-linear strongly coupled system follows. By incorporation of a population-sensing (or âquorum-sensingâ) mechanism, we assume that the chemotactic response is switched off at high cell densities. The response to high population densities prevents overcrowding, and we prove local and global existence in time of classical solutions. Numerical simulations show interesting phenomena of pattern formation and formation of stable aggregates. We discuss the results with respect to previous analytical results on the KellerâSegel model.},

  abstract  = {Experimental tumors contain a significant fraction of microregions that are chronically or transiently hypoxic. Experimental evidence showing that hypoxia (and subsequent reoxyenation) may have a profound impact on malignant progression and on responsiveness to therapy is growing. The clinical relevance of tumor oxygenation in human solid malignancies is under investigation.We have developed and validated a clinically applicable method for measurement of tumor oxygenation in locally advanced cancer of the uterine cervix using a computerized polarographic electrode system. Applying this procedure in patients with cervical cancers â‰¥3 cm in diameter, who gave informed consent, we have been studying the clinical relevance of tumor oxygenation prospectively since 1989.As of June 1995, 103 patients with advanced cancers of the uterine cervix [Federation Internationale des Gynaecologistes et Obstetristes (FIGO) stages Ib, bulky (n = 13), IIa and IIb (n = 51), IIIa and IIIb (n = 34), and IVa and IVb (n = 5)] had entered the study. Fifty % of the patients had carcinomas with median pO2 readings <10 mm Hg, referred to as hypoxic tumors.Tumor oxygenation was found to be independent of various patient demographics and also of pretreatment tumor characteristics, such as clinical tumor stage and size, histological type, and differentiation. However, histopathological examination of the surgical specimens following radical tumor resection in 47 patients showed that low-pO2 tumors exhibited larger tumor extensions and more frequent (occult) parametrial spread, as well as lymph-vascular space involvement, compared to well-oxygenated tumors of similar clinical stage and size. Forty-two patients completing primary radiation therapy and 47 patients who underwent radical surgery were analyzed for treatment outcome after a median observation period of 28 months (range, 3â€“76 months). Patients with hypoxic tumors had significantly worse disease-free and overall survival probabilities compared to patients with nonhypoxic tumors. Cox regession analysis identified tumor oxygenation and FIGO stage as the most important independent prognostic factors. The poorer outcome of the patients with hypoxic tumors was mainly due to locoregional failures with and without distant metastases, irrespective of whether surgery or radiation was applied as primary treatment.Tumor oxygenation as measured with a standardized polarographic method proved to be a powerful new pretherapeutic prognostic parameter providing important information on malignant progression in terms of extracervical tumor spread and radioresistance in advanced cervical cancers.},

Oxygenation profiles and apoptotic indices in human squamous cell cancer of the uterine cervix have been determined, and a subgroup of tumors has been identified with low apoptotic index despite pronounced hypoxia representing carcinomas that consist of neoplastic cells with diminished apoptotic potential. These hypoxic low-apoptotic tumors show a high probability for lymphatic spread and for recurrence despite adjuvant treatment with radiation or chemotherapy in addition to radical surgery. The clinical results presented strongly support the hypothesis derived from experimental studies that the selection of apoptosis-insensitive neoplastic cell phenotypes in a hypoxic microenvironment is an important mechanism for malignant progression in solid tumors.},

  abstract  = {An important consequence of macrophage engulfment of apoptotic cells is suppression of inflammatory responses, which was first defined by assay of TNF-alpha release stimulated by LPS. These effects are apparently mediated in part by paracrine effects of TGF-beta released by the subset of stimulated macrophages that ingest apoptotic cells, which suppresses neighboring cells. However, the apoptotic cell-derived signal that stimulates TGF-beta release, and the nature of any additional signals required for the anti-inflammatory response remain poorly defined. In this study, we investigate the requirements for apoptotic cell engagement of macrophage surface receptors in these responses. We show that the apoptotic cell receptors CD36 and alphavbeta3 contribute to apoptotic cell phagocytosis by mouse macrophages, but are not essential for anti-inflammatory responses, suggesting that the mechanisms of response and phagocytosis are separate. In further defining requirements for response, we confirm the importance of TGF-beta in suppression by apoptotic cells, and identify an additional level of control of these effects. We show that LPS-stimulated mouse macrophage TNF-alpha release is only suppressed if macrophages have first contacted apoptotic cells, and hence, bystander macrophages are refractory to TGF-beta released by phagocytosing macrophages. We conclude that the profound suppression of LPS-driven TNF-alpha release by macrophage populations requires hitherto obscure contact-dependent licensing of macrophage responsiveness to TGF-beta by apoptotic cells.},

In this study we have tested the influence of TauCl on the properties of murine dendritic cells (DC), the major cell population involved in the initiation of an adaptive immune response against pathogenic organisms. N418+, MHC II+, B7-2+ dendritic cells, generated from the mouse bone marrow cells cultured in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, were stimulated by interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide to produce nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-12, in the presence of different doses of TauCl. TauCl differently inhibited the generation of these inflammatory mediators in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, TauCl selectively modulated the ability of DC to induce the release IL-2 and IL-10 from T cells. These results suggest that neutrophil-derived mediators, such as TauCl, at a site of inflammation, may affect the functions of sentinel DC and macrophages, and play a role in maintaining the balance between the inflammatory response and the induction of an antigen-specific immune response.},

  abstract  = {The enormous diversity among bacterial colonies of different species, and among colonies of the same species under different environmental conditions, has long interested microbiologists. Yet it is only comparatively recently that quantitative, rather than merely conceptual, models have been developed to explain the dynamics of bacterial colony formation and growth. Understanding the fundamental processes that drive these dynamics is still at a rudimentary level, though a number of advances have been made. This review traces the history of bacterial colony growth modelling, from the pioneering work of Pirt in the late 1960s, through experimental investigations by Wimpenny and his colleagues in the 1970s, and further models extending from that work to understand complex bacterial colony formations. It concludes with recent results which find that both diameter and height of the colony follow simple power-law behaviour over the entire active growth period (from a few hours to several days old), and that the results of Pirt, Wimpenny and their contemporaries can be re-interpreted.},

In vitro studies have suggested that lysis of neutrophils by virulent amebae may exacerbate the damage seen in amebic liver abscesses. To investigate the role of neutrophils in vivo, we used the severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model of amebic liver abscess formation and compared liver damage in neutrophil-depleted and control mice. We found that neutrophil-depleted animals have significantly larger amebic liver abscesses at early stages of infection and that abscesses in neutrophil-depleted SCID mice lack the prominent inflammatory cell ring seen in amebic liver abscesses in control SCID mice. These data suggest that neutrophils play a protective role in the early host response to amebic infection of the liver.},

  abstract  = {Pneumococcal pneumonia is a leading cause of death and a major source of human morbidity. The initial immune response plays a central role in determining the course and outcome of pneumococcal disease. We combine bacterial titer measurements from mice infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae with mathematical modeling to investigate the coordination of immune responses and the effects of initial inoculum on outcome. To evaluate the contributions of individual components, we systematically build a mathematical model from three subsystems that describe the succession of defensive cells in the lung: resident alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. The alveolar macrophage response, which can be modeled by a single differential equation, can by itself rapidly clear small initial numbers of pneumococci. Extending the model to include the neutrophil response required additional equations for recruitment cytokines and host cell status and damage. With these dynamics, two outcomes can be predicted: bacterial clearance or sustained bacterial growth. Finally, a model including monocyte-derived macrophage recruitment by neutrophils suggests that sustained bacterial growth is possible even in their presence. Our model quantifies the contributions of cytotoxicity and immune-mediated damage in pneumococcal pathogenesis.},

  abstract  = {In the present study we demonstrate that human monocytes activated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were able to produce high levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), previously designated cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor (CSIF), in a dose dependent fashion. IL-10 was detectable 7 h after activation of the monocytes and maximal levels of IL-10 production were observed after 24-48 h. These kinetics indicated that the production of IL-10 by human monocytes was relatively late as compared to the production of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which were all secreted at high levels 4-8 h after activation. The production of IL-10 by LPS activated monocytes was, similar to that of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and G-CSF, inhibited by IL-4. Furthermore we demonstrate here that IL-10, added to monocytes, activated by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), LPS, or combinations of LPS and IFN-gamma at the onset of the cultures, strongly inhibited the production of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF at the transcriptional level. Viral-IL-10, which has similar biological activities on human cells, also inhibited the production of TNF alpha and GM-CSF by monocytes following LPS activation. Activation of monocytes by LPS in the presence of neutralizing anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibodies resulted in the production of higher amounts of cytokines relative to LPS treatment alone, indicating that endogenously produced IL-10 inhibited the production of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF. In addition, IL-10 had autoregulatory effects since it strongly inhibited IL-10 mRNA synthesis in LPS activated monocytes. Furthermore, endogenously produced IL-10 was found to be responsible for the reduction in class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression following activation of monocytes with LPS. Taken together our results indicate that IL-10 has important regulatory effects on immunological and inflammatory responses because of its capacity to downregulate class II MHC expression and to inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes.},

  abstract  = {<sec> <title>Background</title> <p>Inflammation is a highly complex biological response evoked by many stimuli. A persistent challenge in modeling this dynamic process has been the (nonlinear) nature of the response that precludes the single-variable assumption. Systems-based approaches offer a promising possibility for understanding inflammation in its homeostatic context. In order to study the underlying complexity of the acute inflammatory response, an agent-based framework is developed that models the emerging host response as the outcome of orchestrated interactions associated with intricate signaling cascades and intercellular immune system interactions.</p> </sec><sec> <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title> <p>An agent-based modeling (ABM) framework is proposed to study the nonlinear dynamics of acute human inflammation. The model is implemented using NetLogo software. Interacting agents involve either inflammation-specific molecules or cells essential for the propagation of the inflammatory reaction across the system. Spatial orientation of molecule interactions involved in signaling cascades coupled with the cellular heterogeneity are further taken into account. The proposed in silico model is evaluated through its ability to successfully reproduce a self-limited inflammatory response as well as a series of scenarios indicative of the nonlinear dynamics of the response. Such scenarios involve either a persistent (non)infectious response or innate immune tolerance and potentiation effects followed by perturbations in intracellular signaling molecules and cascades.</p> </sec><sec> <title>Conclusions/Significance</title> <p>The ABM framework developed in this study provides insight on the stochastic interactions of the mediators involved in the propagation of endotoxin signaling at the cellular response level. The simulation results are in accordance with our prior research effort associated with the development of deterministic human inflammation models that include transcriptional dynamics, signaling, and physiological components. The hypothetical scenarios explored in this study would potentially improve our understanding of how manipulating the behavior of the molecular species could manifest into emergent behavior of the overall system.</p> </sec>},

  abstract  = {Purpose: To retrospectively compare the computed tomographic (CT) features of liver abscesses caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae with those caused by other bacterial pathogens.Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, with waiver of informed consent. Hospital records of all patients with a diagnosis of liver abscess between July 2003 and July 2010 were retrieved from an electronic hospital database. One hundred and thirty-one consecutive patients with confirmed pyogenic liver abscesses were studied. Data on clinical presentation, comorbid conditions, septic hematogenous complications, hospitalization duration, and abscess-related mortality were obtained. CT characteristics of abscesses including number, distribution, unilocular or multilocular appearance, cystic or solid appearance, gas in cavity, pylephlebitis, thrombophlebitis, and pneumobilia were reviewed. Etiology was established by pus and/or blood culture. Patients were placed into a monomicrobial K pneumoniae liver abscess group and a comparison group. A comparison of the CT features and clinical findings between the two groups was performed. The χ2 analysis or Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables, and Student t and log-rank tests were used for continuous variables. A P value of less than .05 was considered to indicate a significant difference.Results: Monomicrobial K pneumoniae liver abscesses were present in 92 cases (70.2%). On CT images, characteristics more likely to be associated with monomicrobial K pneumoniae liver abscesses than other pyogenic liver abscesses were a single abscess (79.3% vs 56.4%, P = .01), unilobar involvement (82.6% vs 61.5%, P = .01), solid appearance (57.6% vs 35.9%, P = .03), multilocular (94.6% vs 71.8%, P = .01), association with thrombophlebitis (30.4% vs 5.1%, P < .01), and hematogenous complications (28.3% vs 7.7%, P < .01). Thrombophlebitis was associated with higher incidence of hematogenous septic complications (50.0% vs 13.9%, P < .001). Monomicrobial K pneumoniae liver abscesses were associated with significantly shorter duration of antibiotic treatment (P = .018) and hospital stay (P = .005), but there was no significant difference in incidence of septic shock and abscess-related mortality as compared with other pyogenic liver abscesses.Conclusion: Monomicrobial K pneumoniae liver abscesses appear as single, solid, or multiloculated liver abscesses and are associated with thrombophlebitis and septic hematogenous complications.© RSNA, 2011Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101876/-/DC1},

A similar but quantitatively less prominent effect was obtained with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After phagocytosis, but not after exposure to LPS, the PMN progressively released considerable amounts of NAP-1/IL-8 into the culture medium (18.6-50 ng/ml in 18 h). The peptide released was biologically active, as indicated by the transient elevation of cytosolic-free calcium in PMN exposed to aliquots of the culture supernatants, and desensitization by prestimulation of the cells with recombinant NAP-1/IL-8. By producing NAP-1/IL-8 at sites where they phagocytose invading microorganisms, PMN could enhance the recruitment of new defense cells.},

  abstract  = {Clinical outcome prognostication in oncology is a guiding principle in therapeutic choice. A wealth of qualitative empirical evidence links disease progression with tumor morphology, histopathology, invasion, and associated molecular phenomena. However, the quantitative contribution of each of the known parameters in this progression remains elusive. Mathematical modeling can provide the capability to quantify the connection between variables governing growth, prognosis, and treatment outcome. By quantifying the link between the tumor boundary morphology and the invasive phenotype, this work provides a quantitative tool for the study of tumor progression and diagnostic/prognostic applications. This establishes a framework for monitoring system perturbation towards development of therapeutic strategies and correlation to clinical outcome for prognosis.[Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4493â€“501]


 Major Findings We apply a biologically founded, multiscale, mathematical model to identify and quantify tumor biologic and molecular properties relating to clinical and morphological phenotype and to demonstrate that tumor growth and invasion are predictable processes governed by biophysical laws, and regulated by heterogeneity in phenotypic, genotypic, and microenvironmental parameters. This heterogeneity drives migration and proliferation of more aggressive clones up cell substrate gradients within and beyond the central tumor mass, while often also inducing loss of cell adhesion. The model predicts that this process triggers a gross morphologic instability that leads to tumor invasion via individual cells, cell chains, strands, or detached clusters infiltrating into adjacent tissue producing the typical morphologic patterns seen, e.g., in the histopathology of glioblastoma multiforme. The model further predicts that these different morphologies of infiltration correspond to different stages of tumor progression regulated by heterogeneity.

  abstract  = {In the present study we demonstrate that human monocytes activated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were able to produce high levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), previously designated cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor (CSIF), in a dose dependent fashion. IL-10 was detectable 7 h after activation of the monocytes and maximal levels of IL-10 production were observed after 24-48 h. These kinetics indicated that the production of IL-10 by human monocytes was relatively late as compared to the production of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which were all secreted at high levels 4-8 h after activation. The production of IL-10 by LPS activated monocytes was, similar to that of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and G-CSF, inhibited by IL-4. Furthermore we demonstrate here that IL-10, added to monocytes, activated by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), LPS, or combinations of LPS and IFN-gamma at the onset of the cultures, strongly inhibited the production of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF at the transcriptional level. Viral-IL-10, which has similar biological activities on human cells, also inhibited the production of TNF alpha and GM-CSF by monocytes following LPS activation. Activation of monocytes by LPS in the presence of neutralizing anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibodies resulted in the production of higher amounts of cytokines relative to LPS treatment alone, indicating that endogenously produced IL-10 inhibited the production of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF. In addition, IL-10 had autoregulatory effects since it strongly inhibited IL-10 mRNA synthesis in LPS activated monocytes. Furthermore, endogenously produced IL-10 was found to be responsible for the reduction in class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression following activation of monocytes with LPS. Taken together our results indicate that IL-10 has important regulatory effects on immunological and inflammatory responses because of its capacity to downregulate class II MHC expression and to inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes.},

Computational models of HIS dynamics may contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between complex phenomena and immune response; in addition, computational models will support the development of new drugs and therapies for different diseases. However, modeling the HIS is an extremely difficult task that demands a huge amount of work to be performed by multidisciplinary teams. In this study, our objective is to model the spatio-temporal dynamics of representative cells and molecules of the HIS during an immune response after the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into a section of tissue. LPS constitutes the cellular wall of Gram-negative bacteria, and it is a highly immunogenic molecule, which means that it has a remarkable capacity to elicit strong immune responses. We present a descriptive, mechanistic and deterministic model that is based on partial differential equations (PDE). Therefore, this model enables the understanding of how the different complex phenomena interact with structures and elements during an immune response. In addition, the model's parameters reflect physiological features of the system, which makes the model appropriate for general use.},

Consequently, anti-inflammatory therapy in sepsis has been a subject of extensive research, and corticosteroids have long been used to treat severe infections. However, studies conducted in the 1980s failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects of high dose, short-term steroid therapy in sepsis and this therapy was therefore abandoned in the last decade. Recently, a new concept has emerged with more promising results--low dose, long-term hydrocortisone therapy- and this approach is now being evaluated in the treatment of septic shock. It is supported by the observation that many sepsis patients have relative adrenal insufficiency. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effects of steroids and their ability to improve reactivity to catecholamines further contribute to their effects in sepsis. Large randomized clinical trials will be required to determine the exact role of corticosteroids in septic shock.},

Twenty-two patients with nonmetastatic, high-grade, soft tissue sarcomas underwent preoperative irradiation and hyperthermia and pretreatment measurement of tumor oxygenation. The 18-month actuarial disease-free survival was 70% for patients with tumor median oxygen pressure (pO2) values of >10 mm Hg but only 35% for those with median pO2 values of < 10 mm Hg (P = 0.01). There were eight treatment failures; the first site of recurrence was lung in all patients. Median pO2 was 7.5 mm Hg for metastasizing tumors versus 20 mm Hg for nonmetastasizing tumors (P = 0.03). Potential mechanisms and implications for clinical trial design are discussed.},

Attention focuses on the stability of radially symmetric model solutions to perturbations involving spherical harmonics Ylm(ÃÂž, Ãâ ). Linear theory is used to identify bifurcation points at which the radially symmetric steady state loses stability. The first modes to become unstable are shown to correspond to the l = 2 spherical harmonics. Results from group theory and weakly nonlinear analysis indicate the structure of the l = 2 bifurcation point is a transcritical bifurcation in which all nontrivial solution branches are unstable. By proceeding to third order and focusing on a special set of parameter values for which the quadratic terms are negligible, it is shown that the system's behaviour in a neighbourhood of the l = 2 bifurcation point is governed by a subcritical bifurcation. In consequence, the nontrivial asymmetric solution branches in a neighbourhood of the bifurcation point are unstable. The branches of asymmetric solutions bound the domain of attraction of the radially symmetric tumour configuration where it is locally stable. The analytical results that are derived lead us to conjecture that any stable asymmetric tumour structures will involve spherical harmonics of order l Ã¢â°Â¥ 3.},

  abstract  = {When grading and classifying tumours several criteria are taken into consideration. These include the type of cell from which the tumour has arisen, whether it is bestability analysisnign or malignant and its ability to invade the surrounding tissue. In this paper we suggest that the ability with which a tumour invades its host environment can be related to the intercellular adhesion forces which maintain the tumour's structure. We develop a mathematical model to describe the growth of an avascular tumour in response to an externally supplied nutrient. Its development depends on the balance between expansive forces caused by cell proliferation and intercellular adhesion forces which maintain the tumour's compactness. We focus attention on the existence, uniqueness, and stability of steady, radially symmetric solutions to the model. Our analysis shows that as the importance of cell-cell adhesion increases the size of the radially symmetric steady tumour radius diminishes and the number of asymmetric modes to which it is stable increases. Thus we conclude that cell-cell adhesion may provide clinicians with a useful index of the invasive potential of a tumour.},

  abstract  = {In this paper an alternative derivation and interpretation are presented of the classical Keller-Segel model of cell migration due to random motion and chemotaxis. A multiphase modelling approach is used to describe how a population of cells moves through a fluid containing a diffusible chemical to which the cells are attracted. The cells and fluid are viewed as distinct components of a two-phase mixture. The principles of mass and momentum balance are applied to each phase, and appropriate constitutive laws imposed to close the resulting equations. A key assumption here is that the stress in the cell phase is influenced by the concentration of the diffusible chemical. <P></P>By restricting attention to one-dimensional cartesian geometry we show how the model reduces to a pair of nonlinear coupled partial differential equations for the cell density and the chemical concentration. These equations may be written in the form of the Patlak-Keller-Segel model, naturally including density-dependent nonlinearities in the cell motility coefficients. There is a direct relationship between the random motility and chemotaxis coefficients, both depending in an inter-related manner on the chemical concentration. We suggest that this may explain why many chemicals appear to stimulate both chemotactic and chemokinetic responses in cell populations. <P></P>After specialising our model to describe slime mold we then show how the functional form of the chemical potential that drives cell locomotion influences the ability of the system to generate spatial patterns. The paper concludes with a summary of the key results and a discussion of avenues for future research.},

Cytokine production by phagocytosing PMN was also inhibited by IL-10, but to a lesser extent than the LPS-induced production. As shown by Northern blot analysis, IL-10 diminished the levels of TNF, IL-1 beta, and IL-8 mRNAs late after the onset of stimulation of PMN with LPS. In addition, we provide evidence that the kinetics of LPS-induced IL-8 production by PMN is composed of two distinct phases. Specifically, our experiments demonstrated that in the first phase, the production of IL-8 is a process directly induced by LPS that lasts for some hours. After this early wave, a second phase begins that is sustained and leads to an elevated production of IL-8 that appears to be due to the endogenous release of TNF and IL-1 beta. This second wave can in fact be blocked by anti-TNF and anti-IL-1 beta neutralizing antibodies, and by IL-10 as the consequence of its downregulatory effects on TNF and IL-1 beta release. Taken together, these findings identify novel biological actions of IL-10 as a suppressor of the inflammatory response.},

  abstract  = {Macrophage infiltration into inflammatory sites is generally preceded by neutrophils. This suggests neutrophils may be the source of chemotactic factors for monocytes. To identify these putative monocyte attractants, we have systematically prepared neutrophil granules, lysed them, and sequentially purified the released proteins by several reverse phase chromatography procedures. Assays for monocyte chemotactic activity of the chromatography fractions yielded a major peak of activity associated with a protein of 30 kD, according to SDS-PAGE analysis. NH2-terminal sequence of the protein revealed this to be identical to cathepsin G. The monocyte chemotactic activity of human cathepsin G was dose dependent with optimal concentration at 0.5-1 microg/ml. Cathepsin G is chemotactic rather than chemokinetic for monocytes, as demonstrated by checkerboard analysis. Cathepsin G-induced monocyte chemotaxis is partially pertussis toxin sensitive implying the involvement of a G protein-coupled receptor. Enzymatic activity of cathepsin G is associated with its monocyte chemotactic activity, since DFP- or PMSF-inactivated cathepsin G no longer induced monocyte migration. The chemotactic activity of cathepsin G can also be completely blocked by alpha1 antichymotrypsin, a specific inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteinases present in human plasma. In addition, cathepsin G is also a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and a chemokinetic stimulant for T cells. In the course of pursuing these in vitro studies, we established that the T cell chemoattractant, azurocidin/CAP37 from human neutrophil granules, at doses of 0.05 to 5 microg/ml, was chemotactic for monocytes and neutrophils. As predicted from the in vitro chemotactic activity, subcutaneous injection of cathepsin G into BALB/c mice led to infiltration of both mononuclear cells and neutrophils. Thus, the transition of inflammatory exudate from neutrophil to mononuclear cells can be mediated, at least in part, by extracellular release of neutrophil granule proteins such as cathepsin G and azurocidin/CAP37.},

  abstract  = {Fibroblast accumulation in a cutaneous wound requires phenotypic modulation of fibroblasts. In response to injury, resident fibroblasts in the surrounding tissue proliferate for the first 3 days and then at day 4 migrate into the wounded site. Once within the wound, they produce type I procollagen as well as other matrix molecules and deposit these extracellular matrix molecules in the local milieu. By day 7, abundant extracellular matrix has accumulated and fibroblasts switch to a myofibroblast phenotype replete with actin bundles along the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Wound contraction occurs as these myofibroblast gather in the wound extracellular matrix by extending pseudopodia, attaching to extracellular matrix molecules, such as fibronectin and collagen, then retracting the pseudopodia. Once these processes have been accomplished, the fibroblasts appear to undergo apoptosis. Therefore, during cutaneous wound repair, fibroblasts appear to progress through four phenotypes: first proliferating, second migrating, third synthesizing extracellular matrix molecules, and fourth expressing thick actin bundles as myofibroblasts.

  abstract  = {Objective: To determine the feasibility and potential usefulness of mathematical models in evaluating immunomodulatory strategies in clinical trials of severe sepsis.
Design: Mathematical modeling of immunomodulation in simulated patients.
Setting: Computer laboratory.
Measurements and Main Results: We introduce and evaluate the concept of conducting a randomized clinical trial in silico based on simulated patients generated from a mechanistic mathematical model of bacterial infection, the acute inflammatory response, global tissue dysfunction, and a therapeutic intervention. Trial populations are constructed to reflect heterogeneity in bacterial load and virulence as well as propensity to mount and modulate an inflammatory response. We constructed a cohort of 1,000 trial patients submitted to therapy with one of three different doses of a neutralizing antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) for 6, 24, or 48 hrs. We present cytokine profiles over time and expected outcome for each cohort. We identify subgroups with high propensity for being helped or harmed by the proposed intervention and identify early serum markers for each of those subgroups.
The mathematical simulation confirms the inability of simple markers to predict outcome of sepsis. The simulation clearly separates cases with favorable and unfavorable outcome on the basis of global tissue dysfunction. Control survival was 62.9% at 1 wk. Depending on dose and duration of treatment, survival ranged from 57.1% to 80.8%. Higher doses of anti-TNF, although effective, also result in considerable harm to patients. A statistical analysis based on a simulated cohort identified markers of favorable or adverse response to anti-TNF treatment.
Conclusions: A mathematical simulation of anti-TNF therapy identified clear windows of opportunity for this intervention as well as populations that can be harmed by anti-TNF therapy. The construction of an in silico clinical trial could provide profound insight into the design of clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies, ranging from optimal patient selection to individualized dosage and duration of proposed therapeutic interventions.},

Here, we formulate the hypothesis that through these mechanisms, microenvironmental substrate gradients may drive morphologic instability with separation of cell clusters from the tumor edge and infiltration into surrounding normal tissue. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used computer simulations and in vitro experiments. RESULTS: We provide evidence that morphologic instability could be suppressed in vivo by spatially homogeneous oxygen and nutrient supply because normoxic conditions act both by decreasing gradients and increasing cell adhesion and, therefore, the mechanical forces that maintain a well-defined tumor boundary. A properly working tumor microvasculature can help maintain compact noninfiltrating tumor morphologies by minimizing oxygen and nutrient gradients. In contrast, antiangiogenic therapy, by increasing microenvironmental heterogeneity, may promote morphologic instability, leading to invasive patterns even under conditions in which the overall tumor mass shrinks. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that therapeutic strategies focused solely on reduction of vascular density may paradoxically increase invasive behavior. This theoretical model accounts for the highly variable outcome of antiangiogenic therapy in multiple clinical trials. We propose that antiangiogenic strategies will be more consistently successful when aimed at "normalizing" the vasculature and when combined with therapies that increase cell adhesion so that morphologic instability is suppressed and compact, noninvasive tumor morphologies are enforced.},

  abstract  = {Different aspects of reactive-diffusive runaway are discussed in this paper. It is shown that a wide range of reactive nonlinearities can be analysed in essentially the same way, leading to the conclusion that there appear to be only two distinct non-singular, self-similar or approximately self-similar forms of description for non-homogeneous blowup. These exactly self-similar and asymptotically self-similar descriptions have previously been recognized, but are examined here in some detail for many different types of nonlinearity using asymptotic and numerical techniques. It is confirmed that exactly self-similar descriptions only behave non-pathologically in fairly extreme, discrete cases that are very close to a reactive-diffusive (or steady-state) balance under three or more dimensions of symmetry. Quantitative identification of these cases indicates that they may be of dubious practical relevance. It is then shown that only one class of non-singular, asymptotically self-similar descriptions can be found using coordinate perturbation techniques. Resulting solutions are derived to a high asymptotic order and are found to reveal a fairly universal structure for symmetric blowup. A simple analysis reveals that non-symmetric blowup also fits in with this structure, at least to leading order.},

A persistent challenge in modeling this dynamic process has been the (nonlinear) nature of the response that precludes the single-variable assumption. Systems-based approaches offer a promising possibility for understanding inflammation in its homeostatic context. In order to study the underlying complexity of the acute inflammatory response, an agent-based framework is developed that models the emerging host response as the outcome of orchestrated interactions associated with intricate signaling cascades and intercellular immune system interactions.</p> </sec><sec> <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title> <p>An agent-based modeling (ABM) framework is proposed to study the nonlinear dynamics of acute human inflammation. The model is implemented using NetLogo software. Interacting agents involve either inflammation-specific molecules or cells essential for the propagation of the inflammatory reaction across the system. Spatial orientation of molecule interactions involved in signaling cascades coupled with the cellular heterogeneity are further taken into account. The proposed in silico model is evaluated through its ability to successfully reproduce a self-limited inflammatory response as well as a series of scenarios indicative of the nonlinear dynamics of the response. Such scenarios involve either a persistent (non)infectious response or innate immune tolerance and potentiation effects followed by perturbations in intracellular signaling molecules and cascades.</p> </sec><sec> <title>Conclusions/Significance</title> <p>The ABM framework developed in this study provides insight on the stochastic interactions of the mediators involved in the propagation of endotoxin signaling at the cellular response level. The simulation results are in accordance with our prior research effort associated with the development of deterministic human inflammation models that include transcriptional dynamics, signaling, and physiological components. The hypothetical scenarios explored in this study would potentially improve our understanding of how manipulating the behavior of the molecular species could manifest into emergent behavior of the overall system.</p> </sec>},

  abstract  = { Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a cysteine-rich peptide synthesized and secreted by fibroblastic cells after activation with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß) that acts as a downstream mediator of TGF-ß-induced fibroblast proliferation. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies to determine whether CTGF is also essential for TGF-ß-induced fibroblast collagen synthesis. In vitro studies with normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts demonstrated CTGF potently induces collagen synthesis and transfection with an antisense CTGF gene blocked TGF-ß stimulated collagen synthesis. Moreover, TGF-ß-induced collagen synthesis in both NRK and human foreskin fibroblasts was effectively blocked with specific anti-CTGF antibodies and by suppressing TGF-ß-induced CTGF gene expression by elevating intracellular cAMP levels with either membrane-permeable 8-Br-cAMP or an adenylyl cyclase activator, cholera toxin (CTX). cAMP also inhibited collagen synthesis induced by CTGF itself, in contrast to its previously reported lack of effect on CTGF-induced DNA synthesis. In animal assays, CTX injected intradermally in transgenic mice suppressed TGF-ß activation of a human CTGF promoter/lacZ reporter transgene. Both 8-Br-cAMP and CTX blocked TGF-ß-induced collagen deposition in a wound chamber model of fibrosis in rats. CTX also reduced dermal granulation tissue fibroblast population increases induced by TGF-ß in neonatal mice, but not increases induced by CTGF or TGF-ß combined with CTGF. Our data indicate that CTGF mediates TGF-ß-induced fibroblast collagen synthesis and that in vivo blockade of CTGF synthesis or action reduces TGF-ß-induced granulation tissue formation by inhibiting both collagen synthesis and fibroblast accumulation.—Duncan, M.

  abstract  = {The intracellular and extracellular dynamics that govern tumor growth and invasiveness in vivo remain poorly understood. Cell genotype and phenotype, and nutrient, oxygen, and growth factor concentrations are key variables. In previous work, using a reaction-diffusion mathematical model based on variables that directly describe tumor cell cycle and biology, we formulated the hypothesis that tumor morphology is determined by the competition between heterogeneous cell proliferation caused by spatial diffusion gradients, e.g., of cell nutrients, driving shape instability and invasive tumor morphologies, and stabilizing mechanical forces, e.g., cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion. To test this hypothesis, we here obtain variable-based statistics for input to the mathematical model from in vitro human and rat glioblastoma cultures. A linear stability analysis of the model predicts that glioma spheroid morphology is marginally stable. In agreement with this prediction, for a range of variable values, unbounded growth of the tumor mass and invasion of the environment are observed in vitro. The mechanism of invasion is recursive subspheroid component development at the tumor viable rim and separation from the parent spheroid. Results of computer simulations of the mathematical model closely resemble the morphologies and spatial arrangement of tumor cells from the in vitro model. We propose that tumor morphogenesis in vivo may be a function of marginally stable environmental conditions caused by spatial variations in cell nutrients, oxygen, and growth factors, and that controlling these conditions by decreasing spatial gradients could benefit treatment outcomes, whereas current treatment, and especially antiangiogenic therapy, may trigger spatial heterogeneity (e.g., local hypoxia), thus causing invasive instability.

In pharmacology, the Hill equation has been extensively used to analyse quantitative drug-receptor relationships. Many pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models have used the Hill equation to describe nonlinear drug dose-response relationships. Although the Hill equation is widely used, its many properties are not all well known. This ARTICLE aims at reviewing the various properties of the Hill equation. The descriptive aspects of the Hill equation, in particular mathematical and graphical properties, are examined, and related to Hill's original work. The mechanistic aspect of the Hill equation, involving a strong connection with the Guldberg and Waage law of mass action, is also described. Finally, a probabilistic view of the Hill equation is examined. Here, we provide some new calculation results, such as Fisher information and Shannon entropy, and we introduce multivariate probabilistic Hill equations. The main features and potential applications of this probabilistic approach are also discussed. Thus, within the same formalism, the Hill equation has many different properties which can be of great interest for those interested in mathematical modelling in pharmacology and biosciences.}},

  abstract  = {We examined whether the generation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge contributes to increases in lung vascular permeability and water content. Guinea pig lungs perfused at constant flow with Ringer-albumin solution (0.5 g/100 ml) were challenged for 120 min with LPS (Escherichia coli; final concentration 33 ng/ml; n = 5). Lung effluent samples were assayed for TNF-alpha activity using the modified L-929 fibroblast cytolytic assay. TNF-alpha concentrations increased in a time-dependent manner with a peak value of 100 +/- 20 pg/ml noted 90-120 min after LPS. Human neutrophils [polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN; 2 x 10(7)] added to the perfusion solution after endotoxin challenge (n = 5) produced a threefold increase in lung tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity over control values. PMN, added after LPS and activated using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 5 x 10(-9) M; n = 6), produced three- to sixfold increases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and pulmonary capillary pressure (Pcap), wet weight-to-dry weight ratio (W/D), and the pulmonary capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c) over control values (P < 0.05). Activation of PMN with PMA in non-LPS-challenged lungs produced only threefold increases in Ppa and Pcap and did not change W/D and Kf,c. Infusion of an anti-TNF-alpha antibody before the LPS challenge reduced by approximately 50% the increases in Ppa, Pcap, MPO content, Kf,c, and lung wet weight gain (P < 0.05). Therefore, endotoxin-induced TNF-alpha generation in lungs significantly contributes to pulmonary sequestration of PMN. Activation of the sequestered PMN increases pulmonary vascular permeability and tissue water content.},

Nevertheless, biomechanics has yet to reach its full potential as a consistent contributor to the improvement of healthâcare delivery. Because of the inherent complexities of the microstructure and biomechanical behaviour of biological cells and tissues, there is a need for new theoretical frameworks to guide the design and interpretation of new classes of experiments. Because of continued advances in experimental technology, and the associated rapid increase in information on molecular and cellular contributions to behaviour at tissue and organ levels, there is a pressing need for mathematical models to synthesize and predict observations across multiple lengthâ and timeâscales. And because of the complex geometries and loading conditions, there is a need for new computational approaches to solve the boundaryand initialâvalue problems of clinical, industrial, and academic importance. Clearly, much remains to be done. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to review a few of the many achievements in the biomechanics of soft tissues and the tools that allowed them, but, more importantly, to identify some of the open problems that merit increased attention from those in applied mechanics, biomechanics, mathematics and mechanobiology.},

  abstract  = {Eosinophil accumulation is a distinctive feature of lung allergic inflammation. Here, we have used a mouse model of OVA (ovalbumin)-induced pulmonary eosinophilia to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms for this selective recruitment of eosinophils to the airways. In this model there was an early accumulation of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in the lung during the OVA treatment, whereas the increase in infiltrating T-lymphocytes paralleled the accumulation of eosinophils. The kinetics of accumulation of these three leukocyte subtypes correlated with the levels of mRNA expression of the chemokines monocyte chemotactic peptide-1/JE, eotaxin, and RANTES (regulated upon activation in normal T cells expressed and secreted), suggesting their involvement in the recruitment of these leukocytes. Furthermore, blockade of eotaxin with specific antibodies in vivo reduced the accumulation of eosinophils in the lung in response to OVA by half. Mature CD4+ T-lymphocytes were absolutely required for OVA-induced eosinophil accumulation since lung eosinophilia was prevented in CD4+-deficient mice. However, these cells were neither the main producers of the major eosinophilic chemokines eotaxin, RANTES, or MIP-1alpha, nor did they regulate the expression of these chemokines. Rather, the presence of CD4+ T cells was necessary for enhancement of VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) expression in the lung during allergic inflammation induced by the OVA treatment. In support of this, mice genetically deficient for VCAM-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 failed to develop pulmonary eosinophilia. Selective eosinophilic recruitment during lung allergic inflammation results from a sequential accumulation of certain leukocyte types, particularly T cells, and relies on the presence of both eosinophilic chemoattractants and adhesion receptors.},

Staphylococal SSTIs can lead to invasive disease and sepsis, which are among the most significant causes of infectious disease mortality in both developed and developing countries. Human or animal infections with S. aureus do not elicit protective immunity against staphylococcal diseases. Here we review what is known about the immune evasive strategies of S. aureus that enable the pathogen's escape from protective immune responses. Three secreted products are discussed in detail, staphylococcal protein A (SpA), staphylococcal binder of immunoglobulin (Sbi) and adenosine synthase A (AdsA). By forming a complex with VH3-type IgM on the surface of B cells, SpA functions as a superantigen to modulate antibody responses to staphylococcal infection. SpA also captures pathogen-specific antibodies by binding their FcÃÂ³ portion. The latter activity of SpA is shared by Sbi, which also associates with complement factors 3d and factor H to promote the depletion of complement. AdsA synthesizes the immune signaling molecule adenosine, thereby dampening innate and adaptive immune responses during infection. We discuss strategies how the three secreted products of staphylococci may be exploited for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.},

  abstract  = {This paper deals with a chemotactic model of Keller-Segel type. The main feature of the Keller-Segel model is the possibility of blow-up of solutions in a finite time. To eliminate the possibility of blow-up a modified version of Keller-Segel model is introduced. The blow-up control relies on the presence of a pressure function, which increases faster than a logarithm for high enough cells densities: for such a pressure function the solutions cannot blow up in a finite time. Some other conditions are introduced to ensure the global boundedness.},

Experimental observations demonstrate that this biological response can be either blunted (tolerance) or augmented (potentiation) with repeated administration of endotoxin. Both phenomena are of clinical relevance. We show that a four-dimensional differential equation model of this response reproduces many scenarios involving repeated endotoxin administration. In particular, the model can display both tolerance and potentiation from a single parameter set, under different administration scenarios. The key determinants of the outcome of our simulations are the relative time-scales of model components. These findings support the hypothesis that endotoxin tolerance and other related phenomena can be considered as dynamic manifestations of a unified acute inflammatory response, and offer specific predictions related to the dynamics of this response to endotoxin.}},

An abundant supply of nutrient is assumed, so the proliferation of cells is uninhibited (resulting in exponential growth). We consider two possible constitutive relations, Darcy&#039;s law and Stokes flow, in describing the deformation of the tissue and the resulting model takes the form of a coupled system comprising a nonlinear reaction&#150;diffusion&#150;convection equation for the tumour cell concentration and an elliptic system for the deformation and stress fields.<P></P>Using a combination of linear-stability analysis, numerical methods and thin-film approximations, the evolution of the advancing tumour boundary is determined. It is shown that when the tumour and surrounding material properties are the same, a planar interface is always linearly unstable, with the Stokes flow problem being reducible to the Darcy one. We treat the subsequent (nonlinear) evolution and suggest possible extensions to this work.},

  abstract  = {Apoptosis of neutrophils is a key mechanism to control the intensity of the acute inflammatory response. Previously, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±) was reported by some to have pro-apoptotic and by others to have anti-apoptotic effects on neutrophils. The aim of this study was to explain these contradictory results. We found that TNF-Î± at low concentrations strongly decreased apoptosis of neutrophils. However, at higher concentrations, TNF-Î± lost its protective effects, and also reversed the protective effects of interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This pro-apoptotic effect of TNF-Î± was blocked by anti-CD11b and was absent in neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, which cannot produce toxic oxygen metabolites. Under these circumstances, we found that TNF-Î± retained its anti-apoptotic effects even at high concentrations. In conclusion, the protective effects against apoptosis of IFN-Î³, GM-CSF, and TNF-Î± itself are overruled when the concentration of TNF-Î± is high enough to produce a respiratory burst. These dual, concentration-dependent effects of TNF-Î± provide an explanation for previous controversial reports and support a dominant role for TNF-Î± in neutrophil apoptosis.},

In addition to the generation of toxic oxygen radicals and nitric oxide, leukocytes deploy a broad array of antimicrobial proteins and peptides (APP). The majority of APP includes cationic, granule-associated (poly)peptides with affinity for components of the negatively charged microbial cell wall. Over the past few years, the range of cells expressing APP and the potential roles of these agents have further expanded. Recent advances include the discovery of two novel families of mammalian APP (peptidoglycan recognition proteins and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), that the oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent systems are inextricably linked, that APP can be deployed in the context of novel subcellular organelles, and APP and the Toll-like receptor system interact. From a clinical perspective, congeners of several of the APP have been developed as potential therapeutic agents and have entered clinical trials with some evidence of benefit.},

  abstract  = {We showed previously that the competition between bacterial killing by neutrophils and bacterial growth in stirred serum-containing suspensions could be modeled as the competition between a first-order reaction (bacterial growth) and a second-order reaction (bacterial killing by neutrophils). The model provided a useful parameter, the critical neutrophil concentration (CNC), below which bacterial concentration increased and above which it decreased, independent of the initial bacterial concentration. We report here that this model applies to neutrophil killing of bacteria in three-dimensional fibrin matrices and in rabbit dermis. We measured killing of 103–108 colony forming units/ml Staphylococcus epidermidis by 105–108 human neutrophils/ml in fibrin gels. The CNC was ∼4 × 106 neutrophils/ml gel in the presence of normal serum and ∼1.6 × 107 neutrophils/ml gel in the presence of C5-deficient serum. Application of our model to published data of others on killing of ∼5 × 107 to 2 × 108 E. coli/ml rabbit dermis yielded CNCs from ∼4 × 106 to ∼8 × 106 neutrophils/ml dermis. Thus, in disparate tissues and tissuelike environments, our model fits the kinetics of bacterial killing and gives similar lower limits (CNCs) to the neutrophil concentration required to control bacterial growth.},

  abstract  = {We have examined the effect of neutrophil concentration on killing of a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Human neutrophils at concentrations varying from 105 to 107 per ml were mixed in suspension with S. epidermidis at concentrations varying from 103 to 108 colony-forming units/ml, and the concentration of viable bacteria was assayed after various times at 37°C. The rate of bacterial killing depended on the concentration of neutrophils and not on the ratio of neutrophils to bacteria. Below a critical concentration of neutrophils, bacteria growth was greater than neutrophil killing of bacteria even when the ratio of neutrophils to bacteria was 100:1. We fitted the time course of bacterial concentration and its dependence on neutrophil concentration with an exponential function, the exponent of which is (−kp + g)t, where k is the second-order rate constant for bacterial killing, p is the neutrophil concentration, g is the first-order rate constant for bacterial growth, and t is time. We found that k ≈ 2 × 10−8 ml per neutrophil per min, and g ≈ 8 × 10−3/min. Only when p is greater than g/k, which we call the critical neutrophil concentration, does the bacterial concentration fall. Under optimal assay conditions, the critical neutrophil concentration was 3–4 × 105 per ml, a value very close to that (≤5 × 105 per ml) known to predispose humans to bacterial and fungal infections.},

  abstract  = { <p>Serotype K1 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> is a major cause of liver abscesses and endophthalmitis. This study was designed to identify the role of neutrophils in the development of distant metastatic complications that were caused by serotype K1 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. An <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular model was used to assess serum resistance and neutrophil-mediated killing. BALB/c mice were injected with neutrophils containing phagocytosed <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. Serotype K1 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was significantly more resistant to serum killing, neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis and intra-cellular killing than non-K1 isolates (p&lt;0.01). Electron microscopic examination had similar findings as in the bioassay findings. Intraperitoneal injection of neutrophils containing phagocytosed serotype K1 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> led to abscess formation in multiple sites including the subcutaneous tissue, lung, and liver, whereas no abscess formation was observed in mice injected with non-K1 isolates. The resistance of serotype K1 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> to complement- and neutrophil-mediated intracellular killing results in the dissemination of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> via the bloodstream. Escape from neutrophil intracellular killing may contribute to the dissemination and establishment of distant metastases. Thus, neutrophils play a role as a vehicle for helping <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and contributing to the establishment of liver abscess and distant metastatic complications.</p> },

  abstract  = {We build on our earlier mathematical model (Ward & King, 1997, IMA J. Appl. Math Appl. Med. Biol., 14, 39Ã¢â¬â69) by incorporating two necrotic depletion mechanisms, which results in a model that can predict all the main phases of avascular-tumour growth and heterogeneity. The model assumes a continuum of live cells which, depending on the concentration of a generic nutrient, may reproduce or die, generating local volume changes and thus producing movement described by a velocity field. The necrotic material is viewed as basic cellular material (i.e. as a generic mix of proteins, DNA, etc.) which is able to diffuse and is utilized by living cells as raw material to construct new cells during mitosis. Numerical solution of the resulting system of partial differential equations shows that growth ultimately tends either to a steady-state (growth saturation) or becomes linear. Both the travelling-wave and steady-state limits of the model are therefore derived and studied. The analysis demonstrates that, except in a very special case, passage of cellular material across the tumour surface is necessary for growth saturation to occur. Using numerical techniques, the domains of existence of the large-time solutions are explored in parameter space. For a particular limit, asymptotic analysis makes explicit the main phases of growth and gives the location of the bifurcation between the long-time outcomes.},
